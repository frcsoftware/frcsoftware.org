## Exercise 2: Gusset

In the last exercise, we made a single plate in isolation. In this exercise, you will create a plate that connects two box tubes together by combining tools learned previously with one new tool.

To get started, find the "Exercise 2: Gussets" part studio in the "Section 2" folder in your copy of the template document.

Your task is **create a simple gusset for the provided drivetrain frame** by **repeating the workflow** you should have memorized in the previous exercise. The holes for this gusset will be copied into the sketch from the tubes of the frame with the `Use` tool:

<Aside type="caution">
**Do not use the gusset featurescript tool!** This exercise is meant to help you practice the plate workflow and learn how to create a gusset. The gusset featurescript can easily break if the tubes are changed and the gusset shape is inflexible, so it is not recommended.

Your final gusset should look like this:

<Aside type="tip" title="Remember...">

- The keybind for the `Use/Project` tool is the `U` key.
- Arcs should only go on the corners of the gusset, not on every hole.

### Complete?

Try and **remake this gusset** (or a gusset of a different shape, maybe a T) for a **different section of the frame**!

When you're done with the **two gussets**, move on to the next exercise.
