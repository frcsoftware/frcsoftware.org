## Exercise 1: Making Your First Tube

In this exercise you'll be:

1. Following along with the video to learn how we can make box tubes in Onshape
2. Playing with the tools you learned to explore how the concepts work
3. Understanding how these parts interact in 3D Space

### Video Tutorial

Inside of the document you copied and navigated through previously, follow along with this video to create your box tubes and finish the exercise. The `extrude` tool will be introduced through this.

<Aside type="note" title="As you work through the exercise, notice how:">

- Changing the extruded length affects the box tube.
- The dimensions of the sketch translate directly into the dimensions of the tube.

### Extrude Tool Info

<Aside type="note" title="Boolean Options">
Every extrude has options for `new`, `add`, `remove`, and `intersect` that define how your extrude interacts with other parts in the part studio. **If you extrude a tube next to another tube**, you might notice that **they merge together**. Make sure to select the `new` option in your extrude menu, as **sometimes Onshape will default to `add`**.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Endpoint Options">
You can define the end of the extrude depending on an arbitrary length or by using other parts as reference. `Up to face` is pretty commonly used alongside `Blind`.
</Aside>

### Tube Converter Settings

When using the Tube Converter (as shown in the video), make sure your settings match:

If the Tube Converter isn't behaving as expected:

- Only select the rectangles that are not touching, as shown in the video.
- You can remove a selection by clicking the `x` next to the part in the Tube Converter menu.

If you forget the name of a tool, you can press `Alt+C` to search for it.

## Done following along?

Mess around with the tubes a bit more, try extruding different lengths, using different extrude offsets and settings, and play to see how they relate to your final box tube.

After 5 minutes or so, move on to the next exercise.
