"Steal from the best, invent the rest" - Mike Corsetto, Head Coach of Team 1678. Don't ever be afraid of taking inspiration from designs of other robots. This page acts as a design reference and learning page for a wide variety of mechanisms.

<Aside type="note">
A CAD link has been provided when available, but examples without CAD can still be useful to look at with Behind The Bumpers videos and ChiefDelphi threads.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Contribution">
This library of mechanism examples always needs expansion. Follow the [contribution guidelines](/contribution/methodsOfContributing/) to add your own examples or help write Behind the Design pages for existing examples.

## Drivebases

<CardGrid>

[Swerve Drivebases](/mechanism-examples/drivebase/swerve/) - Swerve drivebases, primarily COTS swerve modules
- [Tank Drivebases](/mechanism-examples/drivebase/tank/) - Tank drivebases, not commonly found on robots anymore (Coming Soon)

</CardGrid>

## Intakes

<CardGrid>

- [Pivoting Intakes](/mechanism-examples/intake/slapdown/) - Over-the-bumper intakes deployed on a single pivot
- [Linkage Intakes](/mechanism-examples/intake/linkage/) - Over-the-bumper intakes deployed with a linkage, includes four-bar linkages
- [Under-the-bumper Intakes](/mechanism-examples/intake/utb/) - Intakes that acquire game pieces underneath the bumpers (Coming Soon)

</CardGrid>

## Game Piece Manipulation

<CardGrid>

- [Shooters](/mechanism-examples/shooter/) - Mechanisms designed to shoot game pieces
- [End Effectors](/mechanism-examples/end-effector/) - Unique mechanisms for game piece scoring, sometimes combined with intaking (Coming Soon)
- [Indexers](/mechanism-examples/indexer/) - Mechanisms for transporting game pieces from one part of a robot to another (Coming Soon)

</CardGrid>

## Linear Extensions

<CardGrid>

- [Continuous Elevators](/mechanism-examples/elevator/continuous/) - Elevators with continuous rigging
- [Cascade Elevators](/mechanism-examples/elevator/cascade/) - Elevators with cascade rigging
- [Telescoping Extensions](/mechanism-examples/telescope/) - Telescoping extension mechanisms (Coming Soon)

</CardGrid>

## Rotating Mechanisms

<CardGrid>

- [Pivots](/mechanism-examples/pivots/) - Mechanisms designed to rotate other mechanisms vertically
- [Turrets](/mechanism-examples/turret/) - Mechanisms designed to rotate other mechanisms horizontally (Coming Soon)
