## Project Overview

You will be designing a simple dead axle pivot. While the arm is not designed for a specific game, it will teach you core concepts applicable to any rotary mechanism.

The project requirements are as follows:

- **Gearbox:** Use Max planetaries.
- **Chain:** Utilize 25 chain with a large sprocket reduction.
- **Axle:** Use 7/8 inch tube for the dead axle and ensure proper support.

To design the arm, this document will be used as reference. After the engineering concepts section, you will follow a rough guide to model a copy of it.

### Engineering Concepts & Decisions

The engineering concepts and decisions made to design the reference pivot are covered in the following sections. We cover these concepts lightly so you can understand the principles enough to design one yourself. The design handbook covers the "why" for these concepts if you would like to gain a deeper understanding.
