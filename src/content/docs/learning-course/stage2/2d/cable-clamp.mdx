## Cable Clamp

Cascade elevators function by moving a fixed length of cable from one side of a clamp to the other side of the clamp, to force the elevator up. This cable clamp is usually bolted to some form of crossmember.

### Reference Design

The reference design uses the TTB cable clamp to maintain consistency in rigging components (they come in [a kit](https://www.thethriftybot.com/products/elevator-dyneema-pulley-kit)). The clamp consists of two plates; the first one is fastened to the tube and the second one is ONLY fastened to the first plate. You can choose to make access holes for the bolts or bolt all the way through the cross member with a crushblock.

<Aside type="note">
The WCP cable clamp uses a similar design but the fasteners go through both plates into the crossmember tube, sharing the clamping force with the crossmember.
