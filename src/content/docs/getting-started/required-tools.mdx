instructions linked [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html).

If you intend to control a physical robot, you may also need to install the game tools. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html),
