## Exercise 4: Full Frame Assembly

To get started, find the "S3 Exercise 4" assembly in the "Section 3" folder in your copy of the template document.

**Follow the video below** to complete the exercise.

1. Insert your Section 3 Exercise 3 Part Studio (with the single gusset).
2. Group all frame components.
3. Insert the MK4i if you haven't already.
4. Fasten the modules to the corners of the frame.
5. Insert bolts using FRCDesignLib (10-32x2.5" Socket Head Cap Screws).
6. Measure the distance between faces to determine the bolt length, rounding up to the nearest size.
7. Fasten the bolts properly.
8. Use the `Replicate` tool (set to `match edges on a plane`) to duplicate bolts across the modules.

<Aside type="tip" title="Threaded Holes">
The holes on the top mounting plate of the swerve module are "tapped" or "threaded". This means that nuts are not needed for the bolts because the threads are in the aluminum plate itself.

When you're done with the drivetrain frame, move on to the final next exercise in 1A, where you'll be putting everything you've learned so far together.
