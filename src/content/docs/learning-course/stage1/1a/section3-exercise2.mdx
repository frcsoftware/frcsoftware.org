## Exercise 2: Swerve Drive Assembly

Now that you've learned to use basic rivets, let's install them on a drivetrain.

To get started, find the "S3 Exercise 2" part studio in the "Section 3" folder in your copy of the template document.

**Follow the video below** to complete the exercise.

<Aside type="tip">
The `replicate` tool is introduced in this exercise. You can use it to easily copy components into similar geometry such as rivets, bolts, or bearings into equal size holes.

1. Copy, paste, and fasten the remaining gussets onto the drivetrain frame.
2. Insert rivets from FRCDesignLib and fasten them to the gussets using the **Replicate** tool.
3. Insert **MK4i** drive modules (Don't worry about the configuration, just leave it as the default).
4. Fasten the modules to the frame. **Don't worry about adding bolts yet**.

<Aside type="tip">
Try and use the assembly circular pattern tool to copy one module around the whole drivebase.

Once the gussets, rivets, and swerve modules are inserted, move on to the next exercise.
