In this guide, we document best practices for Onshape CAD and design standards for FRC.

Reasons for these best practices include:

- Keeping loading times low
- Staying organized, so that making changes down the line is easier and more accessible
- Encouraging top-down design through document structure
- Making CAD resistant to breaking

Why standardize design?

- Make it easier for new designers to succeed; reduce the number of things to learn
- Make it harder to make mistakes - encourage good practice through standardization
- Reduce part cost - only invest in parts that work and last

Essentially, standardizing practices on your FRC team helps to ease the requirement of institutional knowledge by making things "just work".
