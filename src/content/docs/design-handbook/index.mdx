description: An extensive reference manual covering FRC robot design fundamentals and advanced techniques
---

These sections form an extensive and in depth reference manual that covers both fundamentals and advanced techniques in FRC robot design. While examples are given in Onshape, the content is largely CAD software agnostic.

Keep in mind that this category is a large work in progress, and will continue to be added to long after the design guide is finished. Feel free to write your own content for something we don't have yet and we'll try to incorporate it into the website (See [contribution guide](/contribution/methodsOfContributing/)).

## Strategic Design

(WIP) [**Strategic Design**](/design-handbook/strategic-design/) is the holy grail of fundamentals. It can take any team's performance and raise it significantly (with a solid support structure of students and mentors). Strategic design is about all the factors that go into what robot your team decides to build, creating a successful build season schedule for getting it done, and executing it well for competitions. It's about priorities and tradeoffs. It's about designing a robot and playing the game within your capabilities.

## Hardware

These pages are all about robustness and designing with fabrication in mind. This means materials, types of structure, hardware, tolerances, and tools and machines.

(WIP) [**Materials**](/design-handbook/structure/materials/): Different types of common materials in FRC and how to use them best, how to design for manufacturing, and a guide on lightening.
