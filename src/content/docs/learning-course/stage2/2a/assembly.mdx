## Assembly

In your own document, create an assembly, insert the parts and origin cube from the part studio (excluding the reference tubes) with the green checkmark, and group them together. Fasten the origin cube to the origin.

Add the rest of the parts from the part studio, MKCAD, and standard content, using replicate and patterns when you can. You can try using [simplified motors](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6df614f3562416a3f9d98607/w/4e6feba12e09e298d8220fdc/e/7c565c28856cdb62e8b20117).
