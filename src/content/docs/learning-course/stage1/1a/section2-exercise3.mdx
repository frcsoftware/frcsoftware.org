## Exercise 3: Superstructure Gussets & Plate

In this exercise you will be using all of the skills you have learned so far and learn how to use the `Linear Pattern` and `Mirror` features to save time when modeling repeat geometry.

To get started, find the "Exercise 3: Gusset Practice" part studio in the "Section 2" folder in your copy of the template document.

**Using the reference image** below, create the **three frame gussets** and the **large polycarbonate side plate**.

<Aside type="note">
No dimensions are provided; try to be deliberate about what you dimension to and from while you fully define your sketches. Think about if you had rollers or wheels or motors, where would you want to add the dimensions to make sure they had clearance?

<Aside type="tip" title="Remember...">

- For the gussets and plate, copy at most 1 hole per tube from with the `Use` tool - use `linear pattern` for the rest.
- Use the `mirror` tool to make the right or left side of the mounting holes instead of making a third `linear pattern`.

</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Materials">
The two main types of stock materials we use in FRC are **aluminum and polycarbonate** (a type of plastic). The reason we use aluminum instead of steel is because aluminum provides more strength for its weight than steel. Polycarbonate ("polycarb") is much lighter, more flexible, and impact-resistant.

When you're done with the **gussets and large side plate**, move on to the next exercise.
