## Setting up FRCDesignApp

FRCDesignApp is a plugin for Onshape that allows you to use a large library of parts that are useful when designing for FRC.

<Aside type="tip">
FRCDesignApp is the plugin/app that helps you insert components into your documents, while FRCDesignLib is the actual collection of components. FRCDesignApp may get upgraded to include more functionality in the future.
</Aside>

To install it, go to the [FRCDesignApp page](https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Manufacturers%20Models/2ZT7X5D646R3LM3ZND7LGBTYRVM4SVH6CDDGM6I=/description) in the Onshape Appstore.

Press "Subscribe", then "Get for Free". This will automatically add the FRCDesignApp to your Onshape account.

<Aside type="note" title="Notes">
- After subscribing, the FRCDesignLib inserter won't show up in already open documents until you reload. This is a first-time thing though.
- You may have to clear your site data (cache/cookies) and authorize the app when you first open it
