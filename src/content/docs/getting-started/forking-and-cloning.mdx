## Forking
Before beginning, it's necessary to create your own fork of the exercises repository. Before doing so, you need to have followed the instructions in the "Required Tools" section. To do so, go to the [exercises repository](https://gitub.com/frcsoftware/exercises) and click the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

## Cloning
To clone the repository you just created, open VS Code. Then, copy the URL of the repository you just forked. In VS Code, open the version control sidebar (top left), and select "Clone Repository". Paste the URL of your forked repository and select a local directory where you want it to be located. This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine, allowing you to work on the exercises.
