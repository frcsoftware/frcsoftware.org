## Exercise 4: Sketching the Drivetrain Frame

Now that you've sketched individual parts, it's time to create a full drivetrain frame.

In the document you copied previously, navigate to the part studio for Exercise 4.

Watch the video below and follow along to create your drivetrain sketch while learning and practicing several part creation techniques.

Your goal is to sketch and extrude the rectangles shown below, then convert them into tubes using `Tube Converter`.

<Aside type="tip">
Make sure to **mirror or pattern your sketches** using construction lines — don't manually draw both sides.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important Notes for the Sketches">

- Make sure to mirror across both X and Y axes.
- Avoid overdimensioning your sketches — use symmetry whenever possible.
- Make sure the cross beams are also mirrored properly.
- Use the origin as the center reference point for everything.

</Aside>

If your sketch is fully constrained (everything turns black), you're doing it right! You can **now use `extrude` and `tube converter` to turn the sketch into your drivetrain box tubes.**

### Finishing Up

1. **Add cross rails** as you did in the last exercise **to complete the drivetrain tubes.**
2. **Double-check** that no parts are fused together incorrectly.
3. Use the dot and top plane (origin and ground) to verify alignment.
4. Make sure tubes line up properly with the module placements.

Once you're done with the above tasks and checks, move on to the next exercise.
