Each subsystem document should have at least one part studio and one assembly associated with it.

The Stage 2A Basic Shooter is a simple subsystem with no moving parts. This contains only a part studio and a rigid assembly.

### Subsystems with Multiple Degrees of Freedom

You may want to split subsystems with multiple degrees of freedom into multiple rigid assemblies. Each separate moving part of the subsystem should have a 'rigid' assembly (no degrees of freedom allowed for any part), while the top-level subsystem assembly only defines the motion between them.

<Aside type="note">
A rigid assembly, when inserted, is treated as a solid body with no mates calculated. It decreases load time in top-level assemblies greatly. You will learn how to integrate the origin cube into this system for easy parametric mates in [assembly best practices](assembly-setup).
</Aside>

For example, you could split an elevator document into one part studio and corresponding rigid assembly for each stage. The top-level elevator assembly would thus include each of the stage subassemblies within it and the slider mates.

The Stage 2C Slapdown Intake is a subsystem with a static portion and a pivoting portion. Functionally, this contains a part studio, a static assembly for the gearboxes and pivot, a rigid assembly for the arms and rollers, and a top-level assembly combining the two subassemblies.

The Stage 2D Cascade Elevator is a subsystem with a static portion and two subassemblies that slide linearly. This contains a part studio, a static frame/gearbox assembly, assemblies for the first stage and carriage, and a top-level assembly combining the 3 subassemblies with slider mates.
