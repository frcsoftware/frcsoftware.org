## Layout Sketch

The layout sketch is very simple as it uses Maxplanetaries for the gear reduction.

1. Use the origin cube featurescript to insert the origin cube
2. Dimension the cross bar
3. Lay out the pivot location and driving sprocket position above the cross bar. Dimension a construction line between them a distance that will give enough chain length to use an inline tensioner.
4. Create construction circles to represent the pitch circles of both sprockets and the diameter of the motor.
